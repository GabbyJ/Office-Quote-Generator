				  "My roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm making Dwight up. He is very real.",
				 "I don't have a lot of contact with the Scranton branch, but before I left I took a box of Dwight's stationary. So from time to time, I send Dwight faxes... from himself... from the future.",
				 "Last week, Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. And as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs.",
				 " Fact: Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.",
				 "Right now this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company, this would be my career. And, uh, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.",
				 "Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing I've ever had to do, which was just to wait. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as a friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that I was waiting for my wife.",
				 "Yeah. Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.",
				 "Everything I have I owe to this job...this stupid, wonderful, boring, amazing job."]
